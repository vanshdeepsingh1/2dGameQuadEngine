# 2dGameQuadEngine
To make 2D game programming simple for everyone, the Quad Engine was created. Before you start designing, the engine is designed to be implemented in your project. It is specifically designed for 2D games (no support for 3D at the moment) using Java 8 internal libraries, and proposes a set of functions for 2D resource management (images, sprites, animations, tiles...).There are also inputs and outputs, with simple retrieval of keys, mouse movement... Music file storage is also available (Wav, Midi). Windowed and full-screen, with total control of frame rate, are completely supported. The development of the Platformer and Top Down games is greatly simplified in the latest version of the Quad Engine.

# Feature
# FX:

  Management of Resources (_sprites, images) 
  
  Font for text rendering 
  
  Handling of Audio (support for Wav) 
  
  Manipulation of lights (size, color)
  

# Container:
  Fast initialization, with title control and configuration of the screen 
  
  Extrapolation power (machine speed independent) 
  
  Regulation of series (intro, menu, game, credits...) 
  
  Quick managing of capital (relative to resource directory) 
  
  Advanced Use of Photos (sprite, animation, tile, font, parallax)

# Components:

  In the game, the GameObject class handles objects (player, enemies, items) 
  
  Quick control of artifacts 
  
  Object physics treats TileMap collisions with other objects.
  
# Renderer:

  2D dynamic lighting, 2D dynamic lighting 
  
  Using ShadowTypes, 2D shadow rendering (Full, Half, Total, None) 
  
  Rendering photos (sprites, animations, objects, shapes)
  
# TileMap:

  Support for 2D parallax backgrounds 
  
  Implementation based on Tile from Single Image 
  
  Using Tween Engine, Smooth Tile Movement
 

# Instalation

Install at least the Java JDK 8

Choose your favourite IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans...)
